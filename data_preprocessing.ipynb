       " '‚ú®Depression & low self-worth is something I‚Äôve struggled with for as long as I can remember. It creates an incredibly unsafe place inside yourself where life begins and ends. At times, the mania fuels your greatest ideas. Gives you hope for a better future. You reach out to loved ones. You put yourself together. And then creeps in the loathing and fear that all of this is pointless. You have no purpose. No meaning, but to be like this forever. It‚Äôs a trap. A cycle. And if it‚Äôs tied up in the body, it can feel like bricks attached to muscle fibers. \\n\\nWe tell depressed people to exercise, say affirmations, and be around others. These are great suggestions, but only work to temporarily mask the pain: Instead, what we should tell those who struggle with mental health issues is‚Ä¶\\n\\n‚ÄúI see you.‚Äù \\n\\nBecause the reality is‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre smart. We know this is not us. We know what we must to do. We know what lives beyond the pain and negative thinking. And we know it‚Äôs just a rollercoaster ride until the waves crash in towards peace again. To see someone in their suffering goes far beyond a ‚Äúwhite knight‚Äù here to save the day. It is much more simpler than that.\\n\\nIt is love. It is love that guides us home. Every. Single. Time. And to be seen by someone‚Äîtruly seen‚Äîis a gift originated from the heart. If you fear you cannot give at all, give one more time. If we are here on this Earth for anything, it is to simplify the loving experience. And depression is just a lie our brains tell us about what it all means. A depressed person doesn‚Äôt feel unloved because of what is happening TO them. A depressed person feels unloved because of what is happening INSIDE them. That is why the saddest hearts can wear the widest smiles. That is why the only way foreword is to constantly see the truth.\\n\\nGuide yourself back home today. Love and give once more. ‚ù§Ô∏è\\n.\\n.\\n#mentalhealthawareness\\n',\n",

There is no shame in having a flu or a sprained ankle but we worried about being judged  as weak or unstable when we face some mental struggle, so we bury our problems and keep on as nothing is wrong. But as we fear judgement from others we might also be judging ourselves. \\nNot accepting our illness perpetuates our shame. Mindfulness teaches us that when we resist who we are, we are adding another layer to our struggles.\\nWhen we find acceptance for our struggles our relationship with illness begins to change, there is more compassion for the times we can\\'t get out of bed, get to work, we become better listeners to when our body reaches its limits.\\n\\nAs Nayyirah Waheed said \"it\\'s being honest about my pain that makes me invincible\" \\n\\nOn this day as we contemplate our lives let\\'s find a way to shine a little light on your struggles, be tender with ourselves, challenge ourselves, and find acceptance for the entirety of who we are.\\n\\n#mindfulness #acceptance #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthday #mindful_hack_me\\n',\n",

       " 'As two people inspired to make a difference in the world of mental health, we decided to start a series on Mental Health Mondays where we discuss and bring awareness to different disorders. If you would like awareness brought to a mental health issue, please message us and we will gladly help bring awareness to it. This week is anxiety awareness month, an issue that has impacted both co-founders of Mental Houseplants. Here is some of my anxiety story.\\n\\nFrom as far back as I remember, I have always had anxiety. Anxiety disorder runs in my family so perhaps it is genetic, but it could have also developed from childhood trauma. Signs of anxiety disorder in myself include excessive worrying that didn‚Äôt seem to match the situations I was in. I was always feeling on edge, as if I was living day to day in flight of flight of fight. Because my mind was constantly racing with thoughts, I was also always tired, both physically and mentally. I‚Äôd often have a hard time concentrating due to racing thoughts and this would affect schoolwork or even conversations with friends. Sleep seemed impossible for me each night as my racing thoughts kept me awake or from staying asleep, resulting in being tired from day to day. Avoidance was another common anxiety symptom of mine. If certain people, situations, or places made me anxious, I‚Äôd avoid these. Another one was overthinking, where I‚Äôd ruminate too much or assume worst case scenarios. Lastly, constant reassurance was something I always needed to feel confident in myself or my choices. All these symptoms changed my perspective of myself and provided me with a lack of confidence in all aspects of my life. These symptoms can be overwhelming and exhausting to live with each day. It wasn‚Äôt until I sought after therapy and underwent cognitive behavior therapy that helped me learn how to think and see myself differently. For that, I am very thankful that I can live a happier and less stressful life. If this sounds like you, check out the resources we provided in this post.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n#anxietyawareness \\n#anxietysupport \\n#mentalhealthmonday #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealthsupport \\n#mentalhouseplants\\n',\n",
