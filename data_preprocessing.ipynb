It used to be around 25, but now some say it's closer to 30, and this has to do with how our brains develop.\\n\\nThe truth is, many adults still act like kids in some ways. This is a big problem in our culture. We often don't go through all the steps of growing up, don't have good role models, and struggle with handling our feelings as adults.\\n\\nI had a moment when I was in my 30s, sitting on my couch, when I realized that I was emotionally still like a 10-year-old.

       " '✨Depression & low self-worth is something I’ve struggled with for as long as I can remember. It creates an incredibly unsafe place inside yourself where life begins and ends. At times, the mania fuels your greatest ideas. Gives you hope for a better future. You reach out to loved ones. You put yourself together. And then creeps in the loathing and fear that all of this is pointless. You have no purpose. No meaning, but to be like this forever. It’s a trap. A cycle. And if it’s tied up in the body, it can feel like bricks attached to muscle fibers. \\n\\nWe tell depressed people to exercise, say affirmations, and be around others. These are great suggestions, but only work to temporarily mask the pain: Instead, what we should tell those who struggle with mental health issues is…\\n\\n“I see you.” \\n\\nBecause the reality is… We’re smart. We know this is not us. We know what we must to do. We know what lives beyond the pain and negative thinking. And we know it’s just a rollercoaster ride until the waves crash in towards peace again. To see someone in their suffering goes far beyond a “white knight” here to save the day. It is much more simpler than that.\\n\\nIt is love. It is love that guides us home. Every. Single. Time. And to be seen by someone—truly seen—is a gift originated from the heart. If you fear you cannot give at all, give one more time. If we are here on this Earth for anything, it is to simplify the loving experience. And depression is just a lie our brains tell us about what it all means. A depressed person doesn’t feel unloved because of what is happening TO them. A depressed person feels unloved because of what is happening INSIDE them. That is why the saddest hearts can wear the widest smiles. That is why the only way foreword is to constantly see the truth.\\n\\nGuide yourself back home today. Love and give once more. ❤️\\n.\\n.\\n#mentalhealthawareness\\n',\n",

There is no shame in having a flu or a sprained ankle but we worried about being judged  as weak or unstable when we face some mental struggle, so we bury our problems and keep on as nothing is wrong. But as we fear judgement from others we might also be judging ourselves. \\nNot accepting our illness perpetuates our shame. Mindfulness teaches us that when we resist who we are, we are adding another layer to our struggles.\\nWhen we find acceptance for our struggles our relationship with illness begins to change, there is more compassion for the times we can\\'t get out of bed, get to work, we become better listeners to when our body reaches its limits.\\n\\nAs Nayyirah Waheed said \"it\\'s being honest about my pain that makes me invincible\" \\n\\nOn this day as we contemplate our lives let\\'s find a way to shine a little light on your struggles, be tender with ourselves, challenge ourselves, and find acceptance for the entirety of who we are.\\n\\n#mindfulness #acceptance #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthday #mindful_hack_me\\n',\n",

Food freedom is something each and every person on this planet deserves and ALL foods are good and equal. 😋👍\\n\\nHonestly, when I used to hear people and dietitians say that “all food is equal” and there are no good foods vs bad foods, in my head I would be like “yeah right” 😏😒 I never ever thought I would get to a place where an apple and a piece of cake would have the same value to me. 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️\\n\\nFast forward to now, after I’ve done the work in recovery, rewired my brain, and recovered. I was making a grocery list yesterday and I put fruit on the list and then I put chocolate and muffins on the list. In my head I knew I needed to stock up on all groceries, but I wasn’t thinking that the sweets are “bad” and the fruit is “good”. It was just simply FOOD and food that I know my body NEEDS and will use for energy to live a full and happy life. 🥰\\n\\nIf you’ve been restricting your food or listening to diet culture, like I did for 20 years, it’s not always easy to see that diet culture is a complete brain wash. But once you recognize that diets simply don’t work, and that they actually make life miserable, you can jump in and start doing the work to rewire your brain, eat the foods you really want, and ditch diet culture FOREVER. Trust me, if I can do it - so can you! 😊🙌👊💥 xx 💋\\n\\n#food #foodisfuel #foodislife #foodismedicine #nobadfoods #ditchthediet #dietculturedropout #recovery #edrecovery #recovered\\n',\n",

One of them was this weird-looking hot chocolate, yet pretty delicious enough to drink within 2 minutes. \\n\\nA tsp of cocoa powder, oat milk, approx 1 tsp peanut butter (or two?), definitely quite a few chocolate chips, lots of dessicated coconut and a lot of madness.

For me it's not just about women - and men, checking their breasts. It's paramount of course. But it's also about trying to tell people that the consequences of a breast cancer diagnosis go way beyond the treatment. For some of us, many of us, the side effects of treatment, medication, induced menopause and so on can come and go with no warning, and sometimes be debilitating. Tonight the brain fog made me feel sluggish, like if I wasn't in my body, my cognition was definitely impacted, agitated, hilarious and I felt completely high.

       " \"🌟 Did you know that October is National Depression and Mental Health Screening Month? 🌟\\n\\n Mental health is just as important as physical health, and this month serves as a reminder to prioritize our emotional well-being. Here are some interesting facts and tips to raise awareness about mental health screening:\\n\\n1️⃣ Mental health screenings are a valuable tool for early detection and intervention. Just like we get regular check-ups for our physical health, it's essential to assess our mental well-being too.\\n\\n2️⃣ Depression affects more than 264 million people worldwide, making it one of the leading causes of disability globally. However, with proper screening and treatment, individuals can lead fulfilling lives.\\n\\n3️⃣ Mental health screenings are confidential, free, and easily accessible. Many organizations, clinics, and online platforms offer screening tools that can help identify potential mental health concerns.\\n\\n4️⃣ Screening can help identify various mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Early detection allows for timely intervention and support.\\n\\n5️⃣Mental health screenings are not only for those experiencing obvious symptoms.

       " 'As two people inspired to make a difference in the world of mental health, we decided to start a series on Mental Health Mondays where we discuss and bring awareness to different disorders. If you would like awareness brought to a mental health issue, please message us and we will gladly help bring awareness to it. This week is anxiety awareness month, an issue that has impacted both co-founders of Mental Houseplants. Here is some of my anxiety story.\\n\\nFrom as far back as I remember, I have always had anxiety. Anxiety disorder runs in my family so perhaps it is genetic, but it could have also developed from childhood trauma. Signs of anxiety disorder in myself include excessive worrying that didn’t seem to match the situations I was in. I was always feeling on edge, as if I was living day to day in flight of flight of fight. Because my mind was constantly racing with thoughts, I was also always tired, both physically and mentally. I’d often have a hard time concentrating due to racing thoughts and this would affect schoolwork or even conversations with friends. Sleep seemed impossible for me each night as my racing thoughts kept me awake or from staying asleep, resulting in being tired from day to day. Avoidance was another common anxiety symptom of mine. If certain people, situations, or places made me anxious, I’d avoid these. Another one was overthinking, where I’d ruminate too much or assume worst case scenarios. Lastly, constant reassurance was something I always needed to feel confident in myself or my choices. All these symptoms changed my perspective of myself and provided me with a lack of confidence in all aspects of my life. These symptoms can be overwhelming and exhausting to live with each day. It wasn’t until I sought after therapy and underwent cognitive behavior therapy that helped me learn how to think and see myself differently. For that, I am very thankful that I can live a happier and less stressful life.
